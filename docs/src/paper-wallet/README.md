This document describes how to create and use a paper wallet with the Solana CLI
tools.

> We do not intend to advise on how to _securely_ create or manage paper wallets. Please research the security concerns carefully.

## Overview

Solana provides a key generation tool to derive keys from BIP39 compliant seed
phrases. Solana CLI commands for running a validator and staking tokens all
support keypair input via seed phrases.
