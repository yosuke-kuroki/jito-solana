# Send and Receive Tokens

In this section, we'll describe how to create a Solana *wallet*, how to send
and receive tokens, and how to participate in the cluster by delegating stake.
To interact with a Solana cluster, we will use its command-line interface, also
known as the CLI. We use the command-line because it's the first place the
Solana core team deploys new functionality. The command-line interface isn't
necessarily the easiest to use, but it provides the most direct, flexible, and
secure access to your Solana accounts.
