# App Wallets
Solana supports multiple third-party apps which should provide a familiar
experience for most people who are new or experienced with using crypto wallets.

## Trust Wallet
[Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com/) is an app for iOS and Android.  This is
currently the easiest and fastest way to get set up with a new wallet on Solana.
The app is free and getting your wallet set up only takes a few minutes.

## Ledger Live with Ledger Nano S
[Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live) is available as free desktop
software and as a free app for iOS and Android.  It is used to manage apps and
crypto accounts on a Ledger *hardware wallet*, which must be purchased
separately and connected to the device running Ledger Live.

[Ledger Nano S](https://shop.ledger.com/products/ledger-nano-s) is a
hardware wallet which stores the wallet's private keys on a secure device that
is physically separate from the computer, and connects via USB cable.
This provides an extra level of security but requires the user to purchase and
keep track of the hardware device.

Solana does not support the Ledger Nano **X** at this time.
