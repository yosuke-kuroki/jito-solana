title: Mobile App Wallets
---

Solana is supported by multiple third-party apps which should provide a familiar
experience for most people who are new or experienced with using crypto wallets.

## Trust Wallet
[Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com/) is an app available for iOS and Android
and can be used to send and receive SOL tokens.

*Note: Trust Wallet does not support stake accounts or staking operations*

### Trust Wallet Security

Tokens held in Trust Wallet are only as secure as the device on which the app is
installed. Anyone who is able to unlock your phone or tablet may be able to
use the Trust Wallet app and transfer your tokens. To improve security,
you can add a passcode to the Trust Wallet application.
To add a Trust Wallet passcode, open the app and go to
Settings -> Security -> Passcode.

If someone gains access to your Trust Wallet application, they can access your
recovery seed phrase.
Anyone who has access to your seed phrase will be able to recreate
your Trust Wallet keys on a different device. From there, they could
sign transactions from that device rather than on your own phone or tablet.
The seed phrase is displayed when a new wallet is created and it can also be
viewed at any later time in the app by following these steps:

- Go to Setting -> Wallets
- Under the Options menu for a particular wallet tap "Show Recovery Phrase"

## Coin98
[Coin98](https://coin98.app/) is an app available for iOS and Android and can
be used to send and receive SOL tokens.

*Note: Coin98 does not support stake accounts or staking operations*
