##Receiving SOL tokens
 - To receive SOL tokens that you’ve purchased or earned, you need to send your
Receive Address to whoever is sending you tokens.
 - Tap “Receive” to view a QR code and your text address, which is a long string
 of letters and numbers.
 - Tap “Copy” or “Share” to send the address.
 - Be very careful when you copy and paste your receive address anywhere that
you do not miss any characters at the beginning or end of the string.
 - If you send an incorrect Receive address to someone and they send tokens
to that address, **those tokens will be lost forever**.
