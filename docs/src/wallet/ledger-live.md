# Ledger Live and Ledger Nano S
This document describes how to set up a
[Ledger Nano S hardware wallet](https://shop.ledger.com/products/ledger-nano-s)
with the [Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live) software.

**NOTE: While Solana tools are fully integrated with the Ledger Nano S device,
and the Solana App can be installed on the Nano S using Ledger Live, adding and
managing wallet accounts currently requires use of our command-line tools.
Integration with Ledger Live to use Solana wallet accounts on Ledger Live
will be available in the future.**
