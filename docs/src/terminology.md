title: Terminology
---

The following terms are used throughout the documentation.

## account

A persistent file addressed by [public key](terminology.md#public-key) and with [lamports](terminology.md#lamport) tracking its lifetime.

## app

A front-end application that interacts with a Solana cluster.

## bank state

The result of interpreting all programs on the ledger at a given [tick height](terminology.md#tick-height). It includes at least the set of all [accounts](terminology.md#account) holding nonzero [native tokens](terminology.md#native-tokens).

## block

A contiguous set of [entries](terminology.md#entry) on the ledger covered by a [vote](terminology.md#ledger-vote). A [leader](terminology.md#leader) produces at most one block per [slot](terminology.md#slot).

## blockhash

A preimage resistant [hash](terminology.md#hash) of the [ledger](terminology.md#ledger) at a given [block height](terminology.md#block-height). Taken from the last [entry id](terminology.md#entry-id) in the slot

## block height

The number of [blocks](terminology.md#block) beneath the current block. The first block after the [genesis block](terminology.md#genesis-block) has height one.

## bootstrap validator

The first [validator](terminology.md#validator) to produce a [block](terminology.md#block).

## CBC block

Smallest encrypted chunk of ledger, an encrypted ledger segment would be made of many CBC blocks. `ledger_segment_size / cbc_block_size` to be exact.

## client

A [node](terminology.md#node) that utilizes the [cluster](terminology.md#cluster).

## cluster

A set of [validators](terminology.md#validator) maintaining a single [ledger](terminology.md#ledger).

## confirmation time

The wallclock duration between a [leader](terminology.md#leader) creating a [tick entry](terminology.md#tick) and creating a [confirmed block](terminology.md#confirmed-block).

## confirmed block

A [block](terminology.md#block) that has received a [supermajority](terminology.md#supermajority) of [ledger votes](terminology.md#ledger-vote) with a ledger interpretation that matches the leader's.

## control plane

A gossip network connecting all [nodes](terminology.md#node) of a [cluster](terminology.md#cluster).

## cooldown period

Some number of epochs after stake has been deactivated while it progressively becomes available for withdrawal. During this period, the stake is considered to be "deactivating". More info about: [warmup and cooldown](implemented-proposals/staking-rewards.md#stake-warmup-cooldown-withdrawal)

## credit

See [vote credit](terminology.md#vote-credit).

## data plane

A multicast network used to efficiently validate [entries](terminology.md#entry) and gain consensus.

## drone

An off-chain service that acts as a custodian for a user's private key. It typically serves to validate and sign transactions.

## entry

An entry on the [ledger](terminology.md#ledger) either a [tick](terminology.md#tick) or a [transactions entry](terminology.md#transactions-entry).

## entry id

A preimage resistant [hash](terminology.md#hash) over the final contents of an entry, which acts as the [entry's](terminology.md#entry) globally unique identifier. The hash serves as evidence of:

- The entry being generated after a duration of time
- The specified [transactions](terminology.md#transaction) are those included in the entry
- The entry's position with respect to other entries in [ledger](terminology.md#ledger)

See [Proof of History](terminology.md#proof-of-history).

## epoch

The time, i.e. number of [slots](terminology.md#slot), for which a [leader schedule](terminology.md#leader-schedule) is valid.

## fee account

The fee account in the transaction is the account pays for the cost of including the transaction in the ledger. This is the first account in the transaction. This account must be declared as Read-Write (writable) in the transaction since paying for the transaction reduces the account balance.

## finality

When nodes representing 2/3rd of the stake have a common [root](terminology.md#root).

## fork

A [ledger](terminology.md#ledger) derived from common entries but then diverged.

## genesis block

The first [block](terminology.md#block) in the chain.

## genesis config

## leader schedule

A sequence of [validator](terminology.md#validator) [public keys](terminology.md#public-key). The cluster uses the leader schedule to determine which validator is the [leader](terminology.md#leader) at any moment in time.

## ledger vote

A [hash](terminology.md#hash) of the [validator's state](terminology.md#bank-state) at a given [tick height](terminology.md#tick-height). It comprises a validator's affirmation that a [block](terminology.md#block) it has received has been verified, as well as a promise not to vote for a conflicting [block](terminology.md#block) \(i.e. [fork](terminology.md#fork)\) for a specific amount of time, the [lockout](terminology.md#lockout) period.

## light client

A type of [client](terminology.md#client) that can verify it's pointing to a valid [cluster](terminology.md#cluster). It performs more ledger verification than a [thin client](terminology.md#thin-client) and less than a [validator](terminology.md#validator).

## loader
