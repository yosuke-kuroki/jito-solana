title: Sysvar Cluster Data
---

Solana exposes a variety of cluster state data to programs via
[`sysvar`](terminology.md#sysvar) accounts. These accounts are populated at
known addresses published along with the account layouts in the
[`solana-program`
crate](https://docs.rs/solana-program/VERSION_FOR_DOCS_RS/solana_program/sysvar/index.html),
and outlined below.

To include sysvar data in program operations, pass the sysvar account address in
the list of accounts in a transaction. The account can be read in your
instruction processor like any other account. Access to sysvars accounts ÃŸis
always *readonly*.

## Clock

The Clock sysvar contains data on cluster time, including the current slot,
epoch, and estimated wall-clock Unix timestamp. It is updated every slot.

- Address: `SysvarC1ock11111111111111111111111111111111`
- Layout: [Clock](https://docs.rs/solana-program/VERSION_FOR_DOCS_RS/solana_program/clock/struct.Clock.html)
- Fields:
  - `slot`: the current slot
  - `epoch_start_timestamp`: the Unix timestamp of the first slot in this epoch. In the first slot of an epoch, this timestamp is identical to the `unix_timestamp` (below).
  - `epoch`: the current epoch
  - `leader_schedule_epoch`: the most recent epoch for which the leader schedule has already been generated
  - `unix_timestamp`: the Unix timestamp of this slot.

  Each slot has an estimated duration based on Proof of History. But in reality,
  slots may elapse faster and slower than this estimate. As a result, the Unix
  timestamp of a slot is generated based on oracle input from voting validators.
  This timestamp is calculated as the stake-weighted median of timestamp
  estimates provided by votes, bounded by the expected time elapsed since the
  start of the epoch.

  More explicitly: for each slot, the most recent vote timestamp provided by
  each validator is used to generate a timestamp estimate for the current slot
  (the elapsed slots since the vote timestamp are assumed to be
  Bank::ns_per_slot). Each timestamp estimate is associated with the stake
  delegated to that vote account to create a distribution of timestamps by
  stake. The median timestamp is used as the `unix_timestamp`, unless the
  elapsed time since the `epoch_start_timestamp` has deviated from the expected
  elapsed time by more than 25%.

## EpochSchedule

The EpochSchedule sysvar contains epoch scheduling constants that are set in
genesis, and enables calculating the number of slots in a given epoch, the epoch
for a given slot, etc. (Note: the epoch schedule is distinct from the [`leader
schedule`](terminology.md#leader-schedule))

- Layout:
  [EpochSchedule](https://docs.rs/solana-program/VERSION_FOR_DOCS_RS/solana_program/epoch_schedule/struct.EpochSchedule.html)

## Fees

The Fees sysvar contains the fee calculator for the current slot. It is updated
every slot, based on the fee-rate governor.

- Address: `SysvarFees111111111111111111111111111111111`
- Layout:
  [Fees](https://docs.rs/solana-program/VERSION_FOR_DOCS_RS/solana_program/sysvar/fees/struct.Fees.html)

## Instructions

The Instructions sysvar contains the serialized instructions in a Message while
that Message is being processed. This allows program instructions to reference
other instructions in the same transaction. Read more information on
[instruction introspection](implemented-proposals/instruction_introspection.md).

- Address: `Sysvar1nstructions1111111111111111111111111`
- Layout:
  [Instructions](https://docs.rs/solana-program/VERSION_FOR_DOCS_RS/solana_program/sysvar/instructions/type.Instructions.html)

## RecentBlockhashes

The RecentBlockhashes sysvar contains the active recent blockhashes as well as
their associated fee calculators. It is updated every slot.

- Address: `SysvarRecentB1ockHashes11111111111111111111`
- Layout:
  [RecentBlockhashes](https://docs.rs/solana-program/VERSION_FOR_DOCS_RS/solana_program/sysvar/recent_blockhashes/struct.RecentBlockhashes.html)

## Rent

The Rent sysvar contains the rental rate. Currently, the rate is static and set
in genesis. The Rent burn percentage is modified by manual feature activation.

- Address: `SysvarRent111111111111111111111111111111111`
- Layout:
  [Rent](https://docs.rs/solana-program/VERSION_FOR_DOCS_RS/solana_program/rent/struct.Rent.html)

## SlotHashes

The SlotHashes sysvar contains the most recent hashes of the slot's parent
banks. It is updated every slot.

- Address: `SysvarS1otHashes111111111111111111111111111`
- Layout:
  [SlotHashes](https://docs.rs/solana-program/VERSION_FOR_DOCS_RS/solana_program/slot_hashes/struct.SlotHashes.html)

## SlotHistory

The SlotHistory sysvar contains a bitvector of slots present over the last
epoch. It is updated every slot.

- Address: `SysvarS1otHistory11111111111111111111111111`
- Layout:
  [SlotHistory](https://docs.rs/solana-program/VERSION_FOR_DOCS_RS/solana_program/slot_history/struct.SlotHistory.html)

## StakeHistory

The StakeHistory sysvar contains the history of cluster-wide stake activations
and de-activations per epoch. It is updated at the start of every epoch.

- Address: `SysvarStakeHistory1111111111111111111111111`
- Layout:
  [StakeHistory](https://docs.rs/solana-program/VERSION_FOR_DOCS_RS/solana_program/stake_history/struct.StakeHistory.html)
