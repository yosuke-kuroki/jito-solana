# Steps to create a validator

To create a Solana validator, follow the normal [validator workflow](../../running-validator/validator-start.md)
targeting the [Testnet cluster](../../clusters.md).

Note that Testnet validators are automatically staked by a process that runs
every Epoch.  If your validator is running correctly then in a couple of days it
will be staked (and automatically destaked if offline for a prolonged period of
time).
