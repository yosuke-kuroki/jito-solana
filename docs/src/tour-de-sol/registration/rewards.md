## Reward Calculation <a id="how-are-rewards-calculated"></a>

Rewards will be calculated according to the compensation design described in [this forum post](https://forums.solana.com/t/tour-de-sol-stage-1-preliminary-compensation-design/79) and [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11puBSw2THdO4wU-uyDEic-D03jg4ZAooVpcZU0w_4gI/edit#gid=218406032).

Please also see section “2\(f\) Tour de Sol Details” of the [TOUR DE SOL PARTICIPATION TERMS](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15ueLG6VJoQ5Hx4rnpjFeuL3pG5DbrBbE/view) for additional rewards details.

## Requirements to Receive Rewards <a id="what-are-the-requirements-to-receive-rewards"></a>

Participants must have signed the Tour de SOL participation agreement, passed KYC/AML as an individual via CoinList’s platform, as well as filled out the W-8 BEN or W-9 tax form \(depending on your residency\) prior to participating in the Tour. A participant may participate in any and all stages that begin after they complete registration. The final registrations dates will be announced publicly on a stage-by-stage basis.

Lastly, participants must sign Solana’s standard [Token Agreement](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1O4cEUZzeSNoVcncbHcEegAqPgjT-7hcy). The Token Agreement will be made available by Solana prior to the rewards issuance date.

## Tax Implications <a id="what-are-the-tax-implications-of-the-rewards"></a>

Participants are entering into a service agreement with Solana with discretionary compensation associated with the services. They are not considered to be a full-time employee of the company and therefore Solana is collecting W-9 and W-8 BEN forms in order to support tax reporting obligations, if applicable. Solana recommends participants consult with a tax accountant to understand any potential tax implications.

Also, as stated in Sections 2i, 2k and 10c of the [TOUR DE SOL PARTICIPATION TERMS](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15ueLG6VJoQ5Hx4rnpjFeuL3pG5DbrBbE/view):
