## Compensation Calculation
Compensation will be calculated according to the compensation design described in [this forum post](https://forums.solana.com/t/tour-de-sol-updates-to-tour-de-sol-and-bug-bounty-compensation-structure/1132).

Please also see section “2\(f\) Tour de Sol Details” of the [TOUR DE SOL PARTICIPATION TERMS](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15ueLG6VJoQ5Hx4rnpjFeuL3pG5DbrBbE/view) for additional compensation details.

## Requirements to Receive Rewards
Participants must have signed the Tour de SOL participation agreement,
passed KYC/AML , as well as filled out the W-8 BEN or W-9 tax form
\(depending on your residency\) prior to participating in the Tour.

A participant may participate in any and all stages that begin after they
complete registration. The final registrations dates will be announced
publicly on a stage-by-stage basis.

## Tax Implications
Participants are entering into a service agreement with Solana with discretionary compensation associated with the services. They are not considered to be a full-time employee of the company and therefore Solana is collecting W-9 and W-8 BEN forms in order to support tax reporting obligations, if applicable. Solana recommends participants consult with a tax accountant to understand any potential tax implications.

Also, as stated in Sections 2i, 2k and 10c of the [TOUR DE SOL PARTICIPATION TERMS](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15ueLG6VJoQ5Hx4rnpjFeuL3pG5DbrBbE/view):

> 2k - To receive any SOL Reward, a Finalist must sign the Company’s standard form of SOL Reward Agreement which will include the terms and conditions governing the ownership and use of the SOL that are issued as the SOL Reward, including but not limited to applicable lockups required by securities laws, blackout dates and tax reporting information.
