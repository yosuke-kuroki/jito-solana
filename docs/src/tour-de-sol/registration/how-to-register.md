# How To Register

1. **Registration Form** Submit the form [here](https://forms.gle/gGS2z4jTXq6hAZ2X9). Once the form is submitted, our team will review the information and insert the information into a publicly viewable spreadsheet for tracking.
2. **KYC/AML**
   Complete KYC/AML [here](https://tsm.coinlist.co/solana-tour-de-sol/new). \(**Ignore all the references to investment** on the portal; we just used their default template. Apologies for the confusion!\)

   We have prepared a guide to the KYC/AML process [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gz8e34piUzzwzCMKwVrKKbZiPXV64Uq2-Izt4-VcMR4/edit?usp=sharing). Note that KYC/AML is mandatory **before** participating in any stage, and compensation is conditional upon you passing KYC/AML.

3. **Participation Agreement** Instructions for completing the participation agreement W-9 will be emailed out to the email you provided, to be filled out and returned to us.
4. **Tax Documents: W-8 BEN or W9** Once your Coinlist KYC application is approved, our team will send either a W-8 BEN for international participants or a W9 via DocuSign. Fill out the form with the same information you used with CoinList.
5. **Status** The status of your participation agreement will be tracked along with the other registration information. Weâ€™ll also try to notify you upon completion or rejection of any submitted participation agreements.
