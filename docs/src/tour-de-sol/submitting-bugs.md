# Submitting Bugs

Please submit all bugs and feedback as [issues in this Github repo](https://github.com/solana-labs/tour-de-sol/issues).

Given the fast pace of communication in the [Discord channels](useful-links.md), itâ€™s likely issues reported in them may be lost in the information flow. Filing the issues in the Github repo is the only way to ensure the issues get logged and addressed.
