# Replication-client Economics

**Subject to change.**

Replication-clients should be rewarded for providing the network with storage space. Incentivization of the set of archivers provides data security through redundancy of the historical ledger. Replication nodes are rewarded in proportion to the amount of ledger data storage provided, as proved by successfully submitting Proofs-of-Replication to the cluster.. These rewards are captured by generating and entering Proofs of Replication \(PoReps\) into the PoH stream which can be validated by Validation nodes as described in [Replication-validation Transaction Fees](../ed_validation_client_economics/ed_vce_replication_validation_transaction_fees.md).
