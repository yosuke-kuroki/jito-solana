# Running an Archiver

This document describes how to setup an archiver in the testnet

Please note some of the information and instructions described here may change in future releases.

## Overview

Archivers are specialized light clients. They download a part of the ledger \(a.k.a Segment\) and store it. They earn rewards for storing segments.

The testnet features a validator running at devnet.solana.com, which serves as the entrypoint to the cluster for your archiver node.

Additionally there is a blockexplorer available at [http://devnet.solana.com/](http://devnet.solana.com/).

The testnet is configured to reset the ledger daily, or sooner should the hourly automated cluster sanity test fail.

## Machine Requirements

Archivers don't need specialized hardware. Anything with more than 128GB of disk space will be able to participate in the cluster as an archiver node.

Currently the disk space requirements are very low but we expect them to change in the future.

Prebuilt binaries are available for Linux x86\_64 \(Ubuntu 18.04 recommended\), macOS, and Windows.

### Confirm The Testnet Is Reachable

Before starting an archiver node, sanity check that the cluster is accessible to your machine by running some simple commands. If any of the commands fail, please retry 5-10 minutes later to confirm the testnet is not just restarting itself before debugging further.

Fetch the current transaction count over JSON RPC:

```bash
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1, "method":"getTransactionCount"}' http://devnet.solana.com:8899
```

Inspect the blockexplorer at [http://devnet.solana.com/](http://devnet.solana.com/) for activity.

View the [metrics dashboard](https://metrics.solana.com:3000/d/testnet-beta/testnet-monitor-beta?var-testnet=testnet) for more detail on cluster activity.

## Archiver Setup

#### Obtaining The Software

#### Bootstrap with `solana-install`

The `solana-install` tool can be used to easily install and upgrade the cluster software.

#### Linux and mac OS

```bash
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solana-labs/solana/v1.0.0/install/solana-install-init.sh | sh -s
```

Alternatively build the `solana-install` program from source and run the following command to obtain the same result:

```bash
solana-install init
```

#### Windows

Download and install **solana-install-init** from [https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases/latest](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases/latest)

After a successful install, `solana-install update` may be used to easily update the software to a newer version at any time.

#### Download Prebuilt Binaries

If you would rather not use `solana-install` to manage the install, you can manually download and install the binaries.

#### Linux

Download the binaries by navigating to [https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases/latest](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases/latest), download **solana-release-x86\_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.bz2**, then extract the archive:

```bash
tar jxf solana-release-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.bz2
cd solana-release/
export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH
```

#### mac OS

Download the binaries by navigating to [https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases/latest](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases/latest), download **solana-release-x86\_64-apple-darwin.tar.bz2**, then extract the archive:

```bash
tar jxf solana-release-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.bz2
cd solana-release/
export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH
```

#### Windows

Download the binaries by navigating to [https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases/latest](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases/latest), download **solana-release-x86\_64-pc-windows-msvc.tar.bz2**, then extract it into a folder. It is a good idea to add this extracted folder to your windows PATH.

## Starting The Archiver

Try running following command to join the gossip network and view all the other nodes in the cluster:

```bash
solana-gossip spy --entrypoint devnet.solana.com:8001
# Press ^C to exit
```

Now configure the keypairs for your archiver by running:

Navigate to the solana install location and open a cmd prompt

```bash
solana-keygen new -o archiver-keypair.json
solana-keygen new -o storage-keypair.json
```

Use solana-keygen to show the public keys for each of the keypairs, they will be needed in the next step:

* Windows

  ```bash
  # The archiver's identity
  solana-keygen pubkey archiver-keypair.json
  solana-keygen pubkey storage-keypair.json
  ```

* Linux and mac OS

  \`\`\`bash

  export ARCHIVER\_IDENTITY=$\(solana-keygen pubkey archiver-keypair.json\)

  export STORAGE\_IDENTITY=$\(solana-keygen pubkey storage-keypair.json\)

```text
Then set up the storage accounts for your archiver by running:
```bash
solana --keypair archiver-keypair.json airdrop .0001
solana --keypair archiver-keypair.json create-archiver-storage-account $ARCHIVER_IDENTITY $STORAGE_IDENTITY
```

Note: Every time the testnet restarts, run the steps to setup the archiver accounts again.

To start the archiver:

```bash
solana-archiver --entrypoint devnet.solana.com:8001 --identity-keypair archiver-keypair.json --storage-keypair storage-keypair.json --ledger archiver-ledger
```

## Verify Archiver Setup

From another console, confirm the IP address and **identity pubkey** of your archiver is visible in the gossip network by running:

```bash
solana-gossip spy --entrypoint devnet.solana.com:8001
```

Provide the **storage account pubkey** to the `solana storage-account` command to view the recent mining activity from your archiver:

```bash
solana --keypair storage-keypair.json storage-account $STORAGE_IDENTITY
```
