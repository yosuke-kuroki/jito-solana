### master branch
All new development occurs on the `master` branch.

Bug fixes that affect a `vX.Y` branch are first made on `master`.  This is to
allow a fix some soak time on `master` before it is applied to one or more
stabilization branches.

Merging to `master` first also helps ensure that fixes applied to one release
are present for future releases.  (Sometimes the joy of landing a critical
release blocker in a branch causes you to forget to propagate back to
`master`!)"

Once the bug fix lands on `master` it is cherry-picked into the `vX.Y` branch
and potentially the `vX.Y-1` branch.  The exception to this rule is when a bug
fix for `vX.Y` doesn't apply to `master` or `vX.Y-1`.

Immediately after a new stabilization branch is forged, the `Cargo.toml` minor
version (*Y*) in the `master` branch is incremented by the release engineer.
Incrementing the major version of the `master` branch is outside the scope of
this document.

### v*X.Y* stabilization branches
These are stabilization branches for a given milestone.  They are created off
the `master` branch as late as possible prior to the milestone release.

### v*X.Y.Z* release tag
The release tags are created as desired by the owner of the given stabilization
branch, and cause that *X.Y.Z* release to be shipped to https://crates.io

Immediately after a new v*X.Y.Z* branch tag has been created, the `Cargo.toml`
patch version number (*Z*) of the stabilization branch is incremented by the
release engineer.

## Channels
Channels are used by end-users (humans and bots) to consume the branches
described in the previous section, so they may automatically update to the most
recent version matching their desired stability.

There are three release channels that map to branches as follows:
* edge - tracks the `master` branch, least stable.
* beta - tracks the largest (and latest) `vX.Y` stabilization branch, more stable.
* stable - tracks the second largest `vX.Y` stabilization branch, most stable.

## Steps to Create a Branch

### Create the new branch
1. Check out the latest commit on `master` branch:
    ```
    git fetch --all
    git checkout upstream/master
    ```
1. Determine the new branch name.  The name should be "v" + the first 2 version fields
   from Cargo.toml.  For example, a Cargo.toml with version = "0.9.0" implies
   the next branch name is "v0.9".
1. Create the new branch and push this branch to the `solana` repository:
    ```
    git checkout -b <branchname>
    git push -u origin <branchname>
    ```

### Update master branch with the next version

1. After the new branch has been created and pushed, update the Cargo.toml files on **master** to the next semantic version (e.g. 0.9.0 -> 0.10.0) with:
     ```
     scripts/increment-cargo-version.sh minor
     ```
1. Rebuild to get an updated version of `Cargo.lock`:
    ```
    cargo build
    ```
1. Push all the changed Cargo.toml and Cargo.lock files to the `master` branch with something like:
    ```
    git co -b version_update
    git ls-files -m | xargs git add
    git commit -m 'Update Cargo.toml versions from X.Y to X.Y+1'
    git push -u origin version_update
    ```
1. Confirm that your freshly cut release branch is shown as `BETA_CHANNEL` and the previous release branch as `STABLE_CHANNEL`:
    ```
    ci/channel_info.sh
    ```

## Steps to Create a Release

### Create the Release Tag on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub's Releases UI](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases) for tagging a release.
1. Click "Draft new release".  The release tag must exactly match the `version`
   field in `/Cargo.toml` prefixed by `v`.
   1.  If the Cargo.toml verion field is **0.12.3**, then the release tag must be **v0.12.3**
1. Make sure the Target Branch field matches the branch you want to make a release on.
   1.  If you want to release v0.12.0, the target branch must be v0.12
1. If this is the first release on the branch (e.g. v0.13.**0**), paste in [this
   template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solana-labs/solana/master/.github/RELEASE_TEMPLATE.md).  Engineering Lead can provide summary contents for release notes if needed.
1. Click "Save Draft", then confirm the release notes look good and the tag name and branch are correct.  Go back into edit the release and click "Publish release" when ready.

### Update release branch with the next patch version

1. After the new release has been tagged, update the Cargo.toml files on **release branch** to the next semantic version (e.g. 0.9.0 -> 0.9.1) with:
     ```
     scripts/increment-cargo-version.sh patch
     ```
1. Rebuild to get an updated version of `Cargo.lock`:
    ```
    cargo build
    ```
1. Push all the changed Cargo.toml and Cargo.lock files to the **release branch** with something like:
    ```
    git co -b version_update
    git ls-files -m | xargs git add
    git commit -m 'Update Cargo.toml versions from X.Y.Z to X.Y.Z+1'
    git push -u origin version_update
    ```

### Verify release automation success
1. Go to [Solana Releases](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases) and click on the latest release that you just published.  Verify that all of the build artifacts are present.  This can take up to 90 minutes after creating the tag.
1. The `solana-secondary` Buildkite pipeline handles creating the binary tarballs and updated crates.  Look for a job under the tag name of the release: https://buildkite.com/solana-labs/solana-secondary
1. [Crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/solana) should have an updated Solana version.

### Update documentation
TODO: Documentation update procedure is WIP as we move to gitbook

Document the new recommended version by updating `docs/src/running-archiver.md` and `docs/src/validator-testnet.md` on the release (beta) branch to point at the `solana-install` for the upcoming release version.

### Update software on devnet.solana.com

The testnet running on devnet.solana.com is set to use a fixed release tag
which is set in the Buildkite testnet-management pipeline.
This tag needs to be updated and the testnet restarted after a new release
tag is created.

#### Update testnet schedules

Go to https://buildkite.com/solana-labs and click through: Pipelines ->
testnet-management -> Pipeline Settings -> Schedules
Or just click here:
https://buildkite.com/solana-labs/testnet-management/settings/schedules

There are two scheduled jobs for testnet: a daily restart and an hourly sanity-or-restart. \
https://buildkite.com/solana-labs/testnet-management/settings/schedules/0efd7856-7143-4713-8817-47e6bdb05387
https://buildkite.com/solana-labs/testnet-management/settings/schedules/2a926646-d972-42b5-aeb9-bb6759592a53

On each schedule:
1.  Set TESTNET_TAG environment variable to the desired release tag.
    1. Example, TESTNET_TAG=v0.13.2
1.  Set the Build Branch to the branch that TESTNET_TAG is from.
    1. Example: v0.13

#### Restart the testnet

Trigger a TESTNET_OP=create-and-start to refresh the cluster with the new version

1.  Go to https://buildkite.com/solana-labs/testnet-management
2.  Click "New Build" and use the following settings, then click "Create Build"
    1.  Commit: HEAD
    1.  Branch: [channel branch as set in the schedules]
    1.  Environment Variables:
```
TESTNET=testnet
TESTNET_TAG=[same value as used in TESTNET_TAG in the schedules]
TESTNET_OP=create-and-start
```

### Alert the community

Notify Discord users on #validator-support that a new release for
devnet.solana.com is available
