//! Instructions provided by the [`ZK ElGamal proof`] program.
//!
//! There are two types of instructions in the proof program: proof verification instructions and
//! the `CloseContextState` instruction.
//!
//! Each proof verification instruction verifies a certain type of zero-knowledge proof. These
//! instructions are processed by the program in two steps:
//!   1. The program verifies the zero-knowledge proof.
//!   2. The program optionally stores the context component of the zero-knowledge proof to a
//!      dedicated [`context-state`] account.
//!
//! In step 1, the zero-knowledge proof can either be included directly as the instruction data or
//! pre-written to an account. The progrma determines whether the proof is provided as instruction
//! data or pre-written to an account by inspecting the length of the data. If the instruction data
//! is exactly 5 bytes (instruction discriminator + unsigned 32-bit integer), then the program
//! assumes that the first account provided with the instruction contains the zero-knowledge proof
//! and verifies the account data at the offset specified in the instruction data. Otherwise, the
//! program assumes that the zero-knowledge proof is provided as part of the instruction data.
//!
//! In step 2, the program determines whether to create a context-state account by inspecting the
//! number of accounts provided with the instruction. If two additional accounts are provided with
//! the instruction after verifying the zero-knowledge proof, then the program writes the context
//! data to the specified context-state account.
//!
//! NOTE: A context-state account must be pre-allocated to the exact size of the context data that
//! is expected for a proof type before it is included as part of a proof verification instruction.
//!
//! The `CloseContextState` instruction closes a context state account. A transaction containing
//! this instruction must be signed by the context account's owner. This instruction can be used by
//! the account owner to relcaim lamports for storage.
