          Backports to the stable branch are to be avoided unless absolutely
          necessary for fixing bugs, security issues, and perf regressions.
          Changes intended for backport should be structured such that a
          minimum effective diff can be committed separately from any
          refactoring, plumbing, cleanup, etc that are not strictly
          necessary to achieve the goal. Any of the latter should go only
          into master and ride the normal stabilization schedule.

          Backports to the beta branch are to be avoided unless absolutely

          minimum effective diff can be committed separately from any

          include CI/metrics changes, CLI improvements and documentation
          updates on a case by case basis.

          If this PR represents a change to the public RPC API:

          1. Make sure it includes a complementary update to `rpc-client/` ([example](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/pull/29558/files))
          2. Open a follow-up PR to update the JavaScript client `@solana/web3.js` ([example](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js/pull/2868/files))

          Thank you for keeping the RPC clients in sync with the server API @{{author}}.

          The Firedancer team maintains a line-for-line reimplementation of the
          native programs, and until native programs are moved to BPF, those
          implementations must exactly match their Agave counterparts.
          If this PR represents a change to a native program implementation (not
          tests), please include a reviewer from the Firedancer team. And please
          keep refactors to a minimum.
