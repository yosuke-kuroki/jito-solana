# Choosing a Testnet

As noted in the overview, solana currently maintains several testnets, each featuring a validator that can serve as the entrypoint to the cluster for your validator.

Current testnet entrypoints:

* Stable, testnet.solana.com
* Beta, beta.testnet.solana.com
* Edge, edge.testnet.solana.com

Prior to mainnet, the testnets may be running different versions of solana software, which may feature breaking changes. Generally, the edge testnet tracks the tip of master, beta tracks the latest tagged minor release, and stable tracks the most stable tagged release.

### Get Testnet Version

You can submit a JSON-RPC request to see the specific version of the cluster.

```bash
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1, "method":"getVersion"}' edge.testnet.solana.com:8899
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":{"solana-core":"0.18.0-pre1"},"id":1}
```

## Using a Different Testnet

This guide is written in the context of testnet.solana.com, our most stable cluster. To participate in another testnet, you will need to modify some of the commands in the following pages.

### Downloading Software

If you are bootstrapping with `solana-install`, you can specify the release tag or named channel to install to match your desired testnet.

```bash
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solana-labs/solana/v0.18.0/install/solana-install-init.sh | sh -s - 0.18.0
```

```bash
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solana-labs/solana/v0.18.0/install/solana-install-init.sh | sh -s - beta
```

Similarly, you can add this argument to the `solana-install` command if you've built the program from source:

```bash
solana-install init 0.18.0
```

If you are downloading pre-compiled binaries or building from source, simply choose the release matching your desired testnet.

### Validator Commands

The Solana CLI tool points at testnet.solana.com by default. Include a `--url` argument to point at a different testnet. For instance:

```bash
solana --url http://beta.testnet.solana.com:8899 balance
```

The solana cli includes `get` and `set` configuration commands to automatically set the `--url` argument for future cli commands. For example:

```bash
solana set --url http://beta.testnet.solana.com:8899
solana balance # Same result as command above
```

\(You can always override the set configuration by explicitly passing the `--url` argument with a command.\)

Solana-gossip and solana-validator commands already require an explicit `--entrypoint` argument. Simply replace testnet.solana.com in the examples with an alternate url to interact with a different testnet. For example:

```bash
solana-validator --identity-keypair ~/validator-keypair.json --voting-keypair ~/validator-vote-keypair.json --ledger ~/validator-config --rpc-port 8899 beta.testnet.solana.com
```

You can also submit JSON-RPC requests to a different testnet, like:

```bash
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1, "method":"getTransactionCount"}' http://beta.testnet.solana.com:8899
```
