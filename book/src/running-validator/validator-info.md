# Publishing Validator Info

You can publish your validator information to the chain to be publicly visible to other users.

## Run solana validator-info

Run the solana CLI to populate a validator info account:

```bash
solana validator-info publish --keypair ~/validator-keypair.json <VALIDATOR_INFO_ARGS> <VALIDATOR_NAME>
```

For details about optional fields for VALIDATOR\_INFO\_ARGS:

```bash
solana validator-info publish --help
```

## Keybase

Including a Keybase username allows client applications \(like the Solana Network Explorer\) to automatically pull in your validator public profile, including cryptographic proofs, brand identity, etc. To connect your validator pubkey with Keybase:

1. Join [https://keybase.io/](https://keybase.io/) and complete the profile for your validator
2. Add your validator **identity pubkey** to Keybase:
   * Create an empty file on your local computer called `validator-<PUBKEY>`
   * In Keybase, navigate to the Files section, and upload your pubkey file to

     a `solana` subdirectory in your public folder: `/keybase/public/<KEYBASE_USERNAME>/solana`

   * To check your pubkey, ensure you can successfully browse to

     `https://keybase.pub/<KEYBASE_USERNAME>/solana/validator-<PUBKEY>`
3. Add or update your `solana validator-info` with your Keybase username. The

   CLI will verify the `validator-<PUBKEY>` file
