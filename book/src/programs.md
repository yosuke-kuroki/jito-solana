# Programming Model

The Solana *runtime* can execute untrusted on-chain programs written in any
programming language that can target the Berkley Packet Filter (BPF) safe
execution environment. The Solana SDK offers the best support for C programs,
which is compiled to BPF using the [LLVM compiler
infrastructure](https://llvm.org). Alternatively, a client might choose to
bypass LLVM and use Python, Lua or C++ to generate BPF directly via the [BPF
Compiler Collection](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc) (BCC).

## Deploying Programs to a Cluster

<img alt="SDK tools" src="img/sdk-tools.svg" class="center"/>

As shown in the diagram above a client creates a program and compiles it to an
ELF shared object containing BPF bytecode and sends it to the Solana cluster.
The cluster stores the program locally and makes it available to clients via a
*program ID*. The program ID is a *public key* generated by the client and is
used to reference the program in subsequent transactions.

## Interacting with On-chain Programs

After a program has been deployed, a client utilizes it by sending transactions
to the Solana cluster. A transaction contains one or more *instructions*. Each
instruction references the program ID that corresponds to the program that the
runtime should use to execute it. Instructions are executed atomically. If any
instruction is invalid, any changes made within the transaction are discarded.

## Storing State between Transactions

If the program needs to store state between transactions, it does so using
*accounts*. Accounts are similar to files in operating systems such as Linux.
Like files, an account may hold arbitrary data and that data persists beyond
the lifetime of a program. Also like files, an account includes metadata that
tells the runtime who is allowed to access the data and how. Unlike files, the
account includes metadata for the lifetime of the file. That lifetime is
expressed in "tokens", which is a number of fractional native tokens, called
*lamports*. Accounts are held in validator memory and pay "rent" to stay there.
Each fullnode periodically scan all accounts and collects rent. Any account
that drops to zero lamports is purged.

If an account is marked "executable", it will only be used by a *loader* to run
programs. For example, programs compiled to BPF are marked executable and
loaded by the BPF loader. No program is allowed to modify the contents of an
executable account.

Accounts also include "owner" metadata. The owner is a program ID. The runtime
grants the program write access to the account if its ID matches the owner. If
an account is not owned by a program, the program is permitted to read its data
and credit the account.

In the same way that a Linux user uses a path to look up a file, a Solana
client uses public keys to look up accounts. To create an account, the client
generates a *keypair* and registers its public key using the CreateAccount
instruction. Once registered, transactions reference account keys to grant
programs access to accounts. The runtime grants programs read access by
default. To grant write access, the client must either assign the account
to a program ID or sign the transaction using the keypair's *secret key*. Since
only the owner of the secret key can produce valid signatures matching the
account's public key, the runtime recognizes the signature as authorization to
modify account data or debit the account.

After the runtime executes each of the transaction's instructions, it uses the
account metadata and transaction signatures to verify that none of the access
rules were violated. If a program violates an access rule, the runtime discards
all account changes made by all instructions and marks the transaction as
failed.
