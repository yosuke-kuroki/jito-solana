The Solana SDK Test Binary

One of the functions that the SDK tests exercises is the loading and calling of Berkley Packet Filter programs (BPF).

The test file noop_c.o is an ELF object file containing a small BPF program contained in the ELF section named ".text.entrypoint".

The C source file for noop_c.o is noop_c.c and it can be rebuilt using the build.sh script.
The build.sh script depends on LLVM 6.0 to be installed.
